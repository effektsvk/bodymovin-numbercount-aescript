# bodymovin-numbercount-aescript

## Description
This AE script makes animating number count easy. It is basically [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baGCfPyVc4Q) but works with [bodymovin](https://github.com/bodymovin/bodymovin). [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6D-9gvS7_w) is the preview of the script.

## Features

- Automatic number keyframe generator
- Timing functions (linear, ease-in, ease-out, probably more in the future!)
- **Works with [bodymovin](https://github.com/bodymovin/bodymovin)!**

## Issues

- Empty window appears after using the script
- Only works on first layer (be sure to have your Text Layer on the top)

## Contribution
I would be incredibly happy if you help me with this project.
